# Fifa-15-Autobuyer
Project designed to automate functions through EA's Fifa 15 Web App

###### Please Note: This project has been abandoned.
In January 2015, EA took down the web app due to the rise in automated bots using it and causing damage the marketplace. Since this tool relies on the web application to function, I have since abandoned development.
